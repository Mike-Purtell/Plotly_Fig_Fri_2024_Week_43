Fig Fri for this week covers the topic of repairs, with data from the Open Repair Alliance. 

Project Description from Ploty Community:
The Open Repair Alliance report 2 estimates that there are 4,000 community repair groups, operating in 31 countries. These groups of people come together to repair their devices while bringing together their communities.

Figure Friday week 43 repair data comes from activities at the Repair Café International 1. If you’d like to explore data sets from other Open Repair initiatives, you can find them on the downloads page 2.

Each row in the data set represents a citizen who tried to repair their device, noted the problem, the device category, the outcome, and some other relevant information.
